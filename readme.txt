In the process of creating my website, planning and design played a fundamental role. 
I began by sketching out a plan in Figma to visualize how I wanted my website to be structured.
 This involved creating a basic framework, which has been enriched over time as 
I discovered new ideas and concepts.

One of the key decisions I made during the website design was to incorporate visual 
elements that would make the user experience more appealing. This included choosing web
 backgrounds to break the monotony and provide a visually pleasing environment. 
I also devoted time to researching the importance of web usability and accessibility,
 which led me to implement links and features to ensure that the website was easy to navigate
 and understand.

The transition from Figma design to HTML and CSS programming was a significant step in the
 process. Following available manuals and tutorials, I started translating my vision into 
real code. This stage involved facing several challenges, with one of the most prominent
 being the organization of content blocks. Ensuring that these blocks were symmetrical and 
consistent with the planned structure was a process that required time and effort, but the 
results were well worth it.
